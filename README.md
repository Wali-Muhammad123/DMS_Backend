#The Problem
Due to the recent flood disaster in pakistan that affect millions of people, leaving almost 10million of children in need of immidiate and lifesaving support. Hundreds of thousands of homes have been destroyed, while many public health facilities, water systems and schools have been destroyed. Young children are living out in the open with their families, with no drinking water, no food, and no livelihood, exposed to a wide range of new flood-related risks and hazards.

#The Solution
Our solution involve solving the provision of basic ammenities like food, drug, drinkable water, shelter in the most needing part of the world especially coutry like pakistan. Our aim is to get donations from around the world and with the use of Data science to convert them to the ammenities and priotize the distribution of accordingly.

#The Business Model
Our aim to business is based on the data we will have in the near future. We believe these data will be essential and can serve as a source of revenue in the years to come. Also, We believe boards like UN, WHO and Unicef can later come to our support.
